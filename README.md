#🚗🤑🔮 Car_Price_Predictor 🔮🤑🚗
This is my app that uses machine learning algorithms to predict the price of a car based on various features such as mileage, model, year, etc. 🚘💰
It is designed to provide users with an accurate estimate of a car's value before making a purchase or sale. 💸💰
I have also included interactive data visualization tools 📈📉, so that users can explore the data and gain insights into the factors that affect car prices.
Check out my repositories to see this app in action and to learn more about my other projects! 😎
